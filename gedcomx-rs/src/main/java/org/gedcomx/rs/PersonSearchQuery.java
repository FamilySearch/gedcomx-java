 * <p>The person search query provides the mechanism for querying the application for specific persons. The following query parameters apply:</p>
 *

 *     <th>parameter</th>
 *     <th>description</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>start</td>

 *     <td>The number of search results per page.</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>q</td>
 *     <td><p>The query describing the search criteria. A parameter name and value is separated by a colon ':' and each name value pair is separated
 *     by a white space '&nbsp;'.</p>
 *     For example:<br/>
 *     <h4>q=givenName:John surname:Smith gender:male birthDate:"30 June 1900"</h4><br/>
 *     <p>Notice the white space in the birthDate value.  If white space is needed in the value then the value must be wrapped in double quotes. By default
 *     values are exact. For non-exact matches append a tilde '~' at the end of the value such as givenName:Bob~.</p>
