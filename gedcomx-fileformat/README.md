Introduction
------------

Welcome to the GEDCOM X File Format library for Java. This library is used to read and write GEDCOM X File Format as defined
by the [GEDCOM X File Format Specification](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/file-format-specification.md).
It relies on the artifacts produced by the [GEDCOM X project](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx).

Here's how you read a file:

```java
//todo: example code for reading the file.
```

Here's how you write a file:

Using the Library
-----------------

This library is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)-based project with the artifacts being built at [Cloudbees](http://cloudbees.com)
by the [GEDCOM Jenkins Instance](https://gedcom.ci.cloudbees.com/job/gedcomx-fileformat-java-snapshot/). Snapshot artifacts are published
to the [snapshot repository](https://repository-gedcom.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/) and release artifacts to the
[release repository](https://repository-gedcom.forge.cloudbees.com/release/). Here are the Maven coordinates for the artifacts:

* groupId: `org.gedcomx`
* artifactId: `gedcomx-fileformat`
* version: [choose the latest](https://repository-gedcom.forge.cloudbees.com/release/org/gedcomx/gedcomx-fileformat/)

Of course, you can always clone the repo and build the library from source:

```
